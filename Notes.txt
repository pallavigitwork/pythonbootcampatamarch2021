Program -- a set of instructions given to a system with some input to get a desired output. 

-- algorithm/pseudo code/ logic

-- syntax of the program. 



Q1. For a radius, find area of a circle. 

-- define radius as rad=0.0
--define area=0.0 
-- calculate area using the formula - area = 3.141*rad*rad
--print area

java or in python -- 

syntax will change 

class AreaOfCircle{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		double rad=0.0;
		double area=0.0;
		area=3.141*rad*rad;
		System.out.println(area);
	}
}


rad=0.0
area=0.0
area=3.141*rad*rad
print(area)



hello world 


data types in python

number  

string

boolean


- a user for input -- 

string
console- string



Q1. Ask user for two numbers, and create a calc service for them 

int()
float()


Q2. Ask user to enter principle use it as integer, rate, use it as float, and time use it as int.
calculate SI = P*r*T/100
print SI

Operators --


mod -- 

12%3=0 

45%10 = 5

+,-,*,/,%

comparison oprts 

<
>
<=
>=
==
!=

if(a>b):
	certain path

Boolean vars

False
True

OR
AND
NOT

OR
a	b	a or b
T	T	T
F	T	T
T	F	T
F	F	F

AND
a	b	a and b
T	T	T
F	T	F
T	F	F
F	F	F

NOT
a	!a
T	F
F	T

Conditional statement
-
if
if else
if elif else

a. if(condition):
	statements

b. if(condition):
	//st
    else:
	//st

if(condition1):
	st
elif(condition2):
	st
elif(condition3):
	st
else:
	st

if(main condt):
	if(sub condition)



Q4. Ask user for a number, find whether even or odd. 

number%2==0 -- even 


Q5 . find bonus of an employee based on years of work, and print salary with bonus.

yrs	bonus
0-3	3%
3-5	5%
5>	10%


if(yow>=0) and (yow<3))
	st
elif(



While Loop 

while(condition):
	staments



Q5. Find all odd numbers between 1-100


break -- to exit the loop. 


Q6. ask user to enter a number, find whether even or odd, keep repeating.
if entered a number < 0, exit the code. 


{
	code 
}


range(start,end,step)

for var in range():
	work with var datapoint. 


Q7. Ask user for a number, print its table from 1..10. 

number X 1 =number
number X 2= ..



Collections -

List
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.  

Tuple
ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.  

Set
collection which is both unordered and unindexed.  -- unique values


Dictionary
ordered*, changeable and does not allow duplicates.


List
Dictionary 


a collection of collections -- complex data structures. 



Q9. Create a list of 10 numbers, and print the max, min, and average of the list. 

-- create an empty list.
--for loop - 10 times 
ask user for data and add it to the list.

then i will write other code - to find
average
min
max


Q10. Create dictionary which stores employee information. 
EmpID: Emp name, EmpSalar, EmpDesign

-- print informaton. 


emp id is unique === key 

emp data == [] , () 

key=> value 

list of keys ==> a list of values. 


OOPs
everything around us is an object. 

set of properties and a set of functions. 


age
gender
height
weight


..

canTalk
canEat
canDance


Car 

seatCapa
engineType
color

mileage
serviceReqd



BankAcc

acc number
acctype
balance

credit
debit


Class- a template or a blueprint from which objects are derived.
an object is also known as an instance of a class. 

class - object of the class
inheritance. 
Exception handling -- 

PIP

Inheritance -- 

Animal 
2 props and one funct
Landanimal

WaterAnimal

Parent - Child relationship. 

all the properties and functions of the parent class, are available to the child class. 



Exception handling --

errors 

exceptions

try:
	//statements prone to error/exception

except:

Split.

str= "I:am:Bond"

newstr =" I am Bond"


Split functions -- string object 

breaks a string into a collection of list items based on a delimeter.
